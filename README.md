# VSP 2.0 Static Front End

This site was created using the static site builder [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). 

You will need to run the following commands to build the static files.

First install packages (from the root folder)
```
npm i
bundle install
```

Then build the static files
```
jekyll build
```

All static assets are in the `_sites` folder, and you can find the files for this project there. 

You can also find all of the SASS files in the `_scss` folder. 

There are 2 main sections, the main landing page and the dashboard. Both are very bare bones but should be enough to get you started. I can finish the styling and text after.

The site is built using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). You can use any bootstrap styles or class you need to. 

The dashboard page is located at `/dashboard`.
